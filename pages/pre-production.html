                    <h2>I. The Genesis: From Idea to Script</h2>
                    <p>This is where the foundation of the live performance is built. The pre-production stage involves the initial conceptualization, extensive research, and detailed development of the narrative and characters specifically for the stage.</p>

                    <h3>A. Concept Development and Dramaturgy</h3>
                    <p>Before formal writing begins, in-depth research into the thematic core, historical context, cultural relevance, and artistic vision of the story is crucial. This stage also defines the main message and unique aesthetic of the performance.</p>

                    <h3>B. Playwriting and Script Development</h3>
                    <p>The play script or performance text serves as the primary blueprint for the entire stage production. It encompasses dialogue, detailed stage directions, and scenic descriptions. For this thesis, examples of script drafts, revisions, and textual analysis will be presented.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>II. Organizational and Design Planning</h2>
                    <p>Once the script is developed, meticulous logistical and artistic planning commences. Thorough preparation at this stage is essential to ensure a smooth and efficient progression towards the actual performance and its live run.</p>

                    <h3>A. Team Formation and Role Assignment</h3>
                    <p>Each member of the Kolektib plays a vital and specialized role. Here, the specific responsibilities of each person are clearly defined, from the director and playwrights to the various designers (set, costume, lighting, sound) and the stage management team.</p>

                    <h3>B. Budgeting and Resource Allocation</h3>
                    <p>The financial aspect is critical for any stage production. This section will detail the process of creating a comprehensive budget, identifying funding sources, and managing resource allocation for the project.</p>

                    <h3>C. Venue Selection, Stage Design, and Rehearsal Scheduling</h3>
                    <p>This involves selecting appropriate performance venues, conceptualizing and designing the scenic elements, costumes, and props. It also includes creating a detailed and efficient rehearsal schedule to maximize creative development and technical integration time.</p>
